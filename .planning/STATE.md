# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** The interactive 3D robot chatbot — a cute robot that responds with emotions and animations based on LLM-generated answers — must work flawlessly
**Current focus:** Phase 2 COMPLETE — i18n Foundation + Lab Aesthetic

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (i18n Foundation + Lab Aesthetic) -- Plan 2/2 COMPLETE (Phase COMPLETE)
Next: Phase 3 (3D Robot Model)
Status: Phase 2 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-14 — Header, language switcher, mobile menu, expanded translations

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 (reset): Old codebase deleted entirely — starting fresh with Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- Phase 1 (reset): Core dependencies installed: framer-motion, zustand, lucide-react
- Phase 1 (reset): Old Phase 1 requirements (FNDN-01, FNDN-02, FNDN-04, UX-05) marked N/A — no longer applicable
- Phase 2: Use `app/[lang]/` + `generateStaticParams` for i18n — no middleware (static export incompatible)
- Phase 2 (02-01): Saprona for display/headings, MarlinGeoSQ for body text — Saprona distinctive for headlines, MarlinGeoSQ geometric sans for readability
- Phase 2 (02-01): Root layout is bare passthrough, locale layout owns html/body tags — standard next-intl static export pattern
- Phase 2 (02-01): Root redirect uses window.location.replace() — outside [lang] context, needs full navigation
- Phase 2 (02-01): 404 page uses inline styles — outside locale layout chain, Tailwind tokens unavailable
- Phase 3: Use `dynamic({ ssr: false })` for all R3F imports — prevents guaranteed SSR build crash
- Phase 3: Zustand is the only correct bridge across R3F Canvas boundary — React Context cannot cross it
- Phase 8: Use `next-mdx-remote` for blog; verify React 19 compat at install time; fallback is `mdx-bundler`
- [Phase 02]: Phase 2 (02-02): FlaskConical from lucide-react as brand mark placeholder icon -- evokes lab/science aesthetic
- [Phase 02]: Phase 2 (02-02): Ghost button style -- transparent with green border, solid green fill on hover with dark text

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] `.glb` animation clip names unknown until file is provided — `RobotEmotion` TypeScript union and `EmotionController` depend on exact clip names. Unblocked by: get the file early, run `console.log(gltf.animations.map(a => a.name))`.
- [Phase 4] LLM backend CORS headers must be set for `https://rayquasar18.github.io` before chatbot integration works in production — external dependency, coordinate before Phase 4 begins.
- [Phase 8] `next-mdx-remote` React 19 peer dep compatibility must be verified at install time — fallback is `mdx-bundler`.
