# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** The interactive 3D robot chatbot — a cute robot that responds with emotions and animations based on LLM-generated answers — must work flawlessly

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 2: Use `app/[lang]/` + `generateStaticParams` for i18n — no middleware (static export incompatible)
- Phase 3: Use `dynamic({ ssr: false })` for all R3F imports — prevents guaranteed SSR build crash
- Phase 3: Zustand is the only correct bridge across R3F Canvas boundary — React Context cannot cross it
- Phase 8: Use `next-mdx-remote` for blog; verify React 19 compat at install time; fallback is `mdx-bundler`

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] `.glb` animation clip names unknown until file is provided — `RobotEmotion` TypeScript union and `EmotionController` depend on exact clip names. Unblocked by: get the file early, run `console.log(gltf.animations.map(a => a.name))`.
- [Phase 4] LLM backend CORS headers must be set for `https://rayquasar18.github.io` before chatbot integration works in production — external dependency, coordinate before Phase 4 begins.
- [Phase 8] `next-mdx-remote` React 19 peer dep compatibility must be verified at install time — fallback is `mdx-bundler`.
